# Text to SQL with open source llm
This project is for converting natural input to SQL queries and getting the data from SQL database.
Beside the previous way for this, I used open source LLM model here so keep the private information of the client.

## 1. choose the best open source model.
## 2. making a python script.
## 3. Run the script on GPU method for faster.
